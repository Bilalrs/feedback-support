  <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Profile Data:</strong> name, gender, birthday, and phone number (optional; you choose what to share).</li>
    <li><strong>Anonymous Encounter Data:</strong> proximity timestamps when you’re within 15 ft of another user for the required duration. These timestamps are collected on-device, then transmitted securely (TLS) to our AWS Lightsail server for processing and storage.</li>
    <li><strong>Feedback Content:</strong> your 1–5 ratings and freeform comments.</li>
    <li><strong>Sign in with Apple:</strong> we only receive an opaque Apple identifier; no email or password is stored by us.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How We Use Your Data</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>To authenticate you via Sign in with Apple.</li>
    <li>To detect encounters (15 ft proximity + 5 min dwell + 20 min drift) on our server and trigger notifications.</li>
    <li>To power the Radar view, Feedback Breakdown, and weekly digest.</li>
    <li>To send push notifications prompting feedback within 20 min of an encounter.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Sharing & Security</h2>
  <p>All data in transit is encrypted via HTTPS/TLS. Encounter data and feedback are stored encrypted at rest on our AWS Lightsail servers. We do not share your personal details or feedback outside the app.</p>

  <h2>Your Choices</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>You can edit or delete your profile (name, gender, birthday, phone) at any time in Settings.</li>
    <li>You can delete individual feedback items or your entire feedback history via the “Clear History” option.</li>
    <li>To opt out of encounter detection, disable Location Services for this app in your device settings.</li>
  </ul>
