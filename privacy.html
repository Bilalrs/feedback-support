  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>Last updated: July 2025</p>

  <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Profile Data:</strong> name, gender, birthday, and phone number (optional; you choose what to share).</li>
    <li><strong>Location Updates:</strong> your device periodically uploads its GPS location to Apple’s CloudKit service (encrypted in transit).</li>
    <li><strong>Anonymous Encounter Data:</strong> our AWS Lightsail server reads those CloudKit location records, computes which users were within 15 ft of each other for at least 5 minutes (then apart for 20 minutes), and logs those encounters for processing.</li>
    <li><strong>Feedback Content:</strong> your 1–5 ratings and freeform comments after an encounter.</li>
    <li><strong>Sign in with Apple:</strong> we only receive an opaque Apple ID identifier; we do not collect your email or password.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How We Use Your Data</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>To authenticate you via Sign in with Apple.</li>
    <li>To store and sync your profile data via CloudKit.</li>
    <li>To detect and record encounters on our AWS server based on those CloudKit location updates.</li>
    <li>To send you a push notification prompting feedback after each encounter.</li>
    <li>To compile and deliver weekly feedback every Wednesday at 5 PM.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Sharing & Security</h2>
  <p>All data in transit is encrypted via HTTPS/TLS. Profile data and location updates are stored encrypted at rest in CloudKit; encounter logs and feedback are stored encrypted on our AWS Lightsail servers. We do not share your personal details or feedback with any third parties.</p>

  <h2>Your Choices</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>You can edit or delete your profile data (name, gender, birthday, phone) anytime in Edit Profile.</li>
    <li>To opt out of encounter detection, disable Location Services for this app in your device settings.</li>
  </ul>
